      <p>This is a picture of Youtuber BayashiTV. This man loves destroying Italian culture and creating new dishes that are either genius or stupid or disgusting. This picture is taken from his video where he made cucumbers in a different way. He is sustainable because he doesn't waste eggs. I can see that through the video he made with MrBeast. In that video, he commented on a video about wasting eggs and encouraged us to not waste them.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="style-onetwothreehahaha">
        <p>He is telling us to be more sustainable! For example, if you waste food, then he will jumpscare you at 3am in your DREAMS!</p>

       <h3>Da Evil Plastic Bottle</h3>
     </div>
     
     <div class="style-blue">
       <p>This is Da Evil Plastic Bottle. In this picture, the water bottle is about to be a contribute to the ocean pollution. The evil face on the water bottle suggests that they will ruin the ocean. We can take action by simply picking up trash you see and putting them in the trash can or recycling plastic after use.</p>
     </div>
     
     <div class="style-onetwothreehahaha">
       <p>We should stop ocean pollution because if fish eat it, they will get poisoned and if other species (including humans) eat them, they will also get poisoned. Also, the fishes might get trapped in the water bottles and they won't be able to breathe or they will get trapped. </p>

    <h3>Toxic Car Farts</h3>
    </div>
    
    <div class="style-blue">
      <p>This is a picture of a car releasing bad gases like carbon dioxide and water vapour. These gases are greenhouse gases, which damage the earth's atmosphere. In the picture, the chicken is suffering from the toxic gas from the car.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="style-onetwothreehahaha">
       <p>An example of how we can reduce carbon pollution is by taking public transport instead of private cars. If you don't take action, the car is going to make you smell its toxic gas for 14 days in a row. </p>

     <h3>Get out, Fishes!</h3>
    </div>
    
    <div class="style-blue">
     <p>This picture shows the land reclamation problem around the world. For example, Hong Kong does lots of land reclamation like the HK International Airport and the Ma On Shan Promenade. The picture is called "Get out, Fishes!" because the humans that are doing land reclamation on the sea have to get the fish out before doing the construction. This forces the fish out of what might be their home.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="style-onetwothreehahaha">
      <p>You can take action by raising awarenesson social media or real life or you can use other ways to raise awareness as well! If you don't take action, the fish will escape to your stomach and swim around it and make you have a painful stomach.</p>

      <h3>Say NO to Shark Fin Soup</h3>
    </div>
    
    <div class="style-blue">
      <p>Say NO to Shark Fin Soup! Did you know how Shark Fin Soup was made? The fishermen cut the shark's fins off and throw them back in the sea alive! The sharks will sink all the way to the bottom without his fins and they will likely die. People think they taste good but the taste of the soup actually just comes from the broth.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="style-onetwothreehahaha">
      <p>To save the sharks, raise awareness and stop eating shark fin soup! If you don't do one of these things, the sharks are gonna eat you!</p>
